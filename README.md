# Building-Spam-Filter-with-Naive-Bayes
In this project, I'm going to build a spam filter for SMS messages by using the Multinomial Naive Bayes Algorithm.
My goal is to build a spam filter that classifies the new SMS messages with an accuracy greater than 80%.
To train the algorithm, I'll use this [dataset](https://data.world/lylepratt/sms-spam), created by Lyle Pratt, from [data.world](https://data.world/). The dataset is in .txt format. So I have converted it into a .csv file. The dataset contains 5,574 SMS that are already classified by humans.
